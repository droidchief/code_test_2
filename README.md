# code_test

The test consists of 4 tests.
We are using Flutter 3.22.3; but it should not be a problem if you run if with any higher version of Flutter. 
The test is purely in Flutter, so you should not have any problem run it on Android or iOS. 
Every instructions of each test is inside the app itself.
